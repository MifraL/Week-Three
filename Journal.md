- Decisions to make when you clean and transform the material

When I had to merge words that were about the same topic ... When I was doing regex I realized how much time it would take me if I didn't know the commands...

- What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do?

I believe by showing your work, it will be easier to know where you made your mistakes. As was said in the recording about a mistake that totally wasted a lot of time and analysis.... I could see how that would be possible in digital history... The coding can help to reduce the work load if you know what you're doing and I believe without these instructions I would be even more lost. I can even if I had to do it simply based on my own knowledge then I could guaranty that I won't finish any coding. So I believe it is necessary to learn programming, at least the basics. It could help a lot even if you are not planning to be a digital historian but rather just a historian or etc. 

- Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how youâ€™ve written history to date...

As can be seen, in the readings even the academics published by historians use digital data to help them with their research process. Even before the classes were made online, in my history classes we had projects related to publicizing online... But most of my projects have been about doing research essays of which the resources were mostly from online as compared to in-person archives or books. I believe whether when you're working, it is made easier to reference when you have shown you're work through the project that you've been assigned. It is made easier to check for more context when you now where you found the information as well as fixing your mistakes.

It would only get more and more necessary with the internet and I believe the recent pandemic has made it crystal clear the importance of world wide web. It has only made it a necessity which means its uses will only grow. In relation to history, there's more resources being made available online to be accessible anytime anywhere in any situation.
