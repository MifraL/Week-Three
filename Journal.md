- Decisions to make when you clean and transform the material

When I had to merge words that were about the same topic ... When I was doing regex I realized how much time it would take me if I didn't know the simplified commands.

I reallized that it is essential to keep tabs of your steps so that it could be easier to recognize your mistakes

Identify the sources that you're getting the materials from 

Run each code line by line to catch the errros so that it can be fixed early

- What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do?

I believe by showing your work, it will be easier to know where you made your mistakes. As was said in the recording about a mistake that totally wasted a lot of time and analysis for the prof. I could see how that would be possible in digital history where there's a lot data to sort through. 

It would only get more and more necessary with the advancement of the internet. I believe the recent pandemic has made it crystal clear the importance of world wide web. It has only made it a necessity which means its uses will only grow. In relation to history, there's more resources being made available online to be accessible anytime anywhere in any situation. 

The application do data processing can help to reduce the work load if you know what you're doing and I believe without the instructions given to me by the prof, I would be even more lost. To do it simply based on my own knowledge, I won't finish any of the exercises. So I believe it is necessary to learn programming, at least the basics. It could help a lot even if you are not planning to be a digital historian. Research now can be made easier through data processing from various applications and for them to be used accurately, it is only right to know to code a bit.

- Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how youâ€™ve written history to date...

As can be seen, in the readings even the books published by historians use digital data to help in their research. Even before the classes were made online, in my history classes we had projects related to publicizing online... But most of my projects have been about doing research essays of which the resources were mostly from online as compared to in-person archives or books. I feel like as students, it would only get easier to access the sources online.  

I believe whether when you're working, it is made easier to reference when you have shown your work as well as fixing your mistakes.
The idea of showing your work has been always present in math questions and usually points will be given for the steps and the answer. One can't do without the other. I believe this concept will become essential in history as history is about recording all events.It only makes sense that whether the digital history is hidden or visible as long as it is part of the research, it should be accessible so that the people can understand the topic better.
