-I coult not openit at first
-Had to dowlaod java
-Then after trying to open it it worked when I extracted the files

-I did not select the contents numbers when doing merge
-There was 3 final columns … like sidxi 
-Then I found this video and realized where I made my mistake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD-VOjXZN4k&list=PLw4wN8PcDj_CcydCNwqUUHWZCIkA3obZC&index=10
