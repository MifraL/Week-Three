Recording 

- clean data for years
- go to platform = excel 
- depended on precise measurements = one wrong cell data = cost entire analysis to be off
- "hidden" or visible data
- methods/ materials are both measy
- reflect the value of showing your work 

Reading 1:James Baker, 2017. ‘The Soft Digital History That Underpins My Book.’

-	Space when writing about the context within printed images were made and sold
-	Not see patterns… removed stationers leaving only the former maps so that author could think about spatial patterns associated with other business categories 
-	Maps were not added into his book they served as to help in his thinking process… and analysis 
-	Criticized by his student for omitting them 

Reading 2: James Baker, 2017. 'The hard digital history that underpins my book.'

-	Talks a bit about the previous article and how he hid the digital work… or rather did not make it to the final product
-	Good history = concise, precise and selective where things are left out in interpretations 
-	In book it was not left out because its digital but because that is what happened when you turn research into publication 
Visible digital history that did make it into his book 
-	Network analysis is an influential analysis = data and visualisations = not accurate representation of data = an aid
-	Combined for analysis 
-	Problem = how to do this corpus level work… based on his knowledge 
-	patterns unnoticed like assessing the quality of prints themselves and how they impacted Isaac’s career
-	“this work did was help me balance the scales, help me move between close and far, macro and micro, print and print trade, give me confidence to make strong statement”
-	Running multiple network analysis rather than one 
-	historians rarely use phrases like data models, etc. but they still do that during their research… digital history just makes that more obvious.
